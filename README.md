2. Have a sendgrid account
3. In order to make it work please rename the .env.dev file to .env
4. change the .env variables to suit you well (e.g. your db connection credentials and the api keys of sendgrid access)
4. Node js 14 and npm must be installed on your local environment (only 14 v has been tested perhaps other version should work as well)
